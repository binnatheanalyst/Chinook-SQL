This project explores and analyzes the Chinook Database, a sample dataset that simulates a digital music store. It contains information about artists, albums, media tracks, playlists, customers, invoices, and employees - designed to represent a real-world business scenario similar to platforms like iTunes.

**Introduction**
Database Structure:
The Chinook database includes the following key tables:
Artist – stores artist names.
Album – contains albums associated with each artist.
Track – details of individual tracks, including genre, media type, and price.
Genre – classifies music styles.
Customer – customer information, including contact details and country.
Invoice & InvoiceLine – records of sales transactions.
Employee – data on sales representatives.
Playlist & PlaylistTrack – defines user playlists and their tracks.

**Skills Demonstrated:** - Advanced SQL queries (JOINs, CTEs, window functions, aggregations).

**Analytical Questions:** - I'll be using SQL to answer the following questions;
What are the top 5 best-selling artists by total sales?
Which customers generate the highest revenue by country?
What are the most popular genres in each region?
Who are the most productive sales representatives?
What is the average order value and purchase frequency per customer?
